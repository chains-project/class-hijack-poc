- Unzip the `data.zip` file in reposilite folder
- Startup reposilite to fake malicious takeover of json-schema: `cd reposilite && docker compose up -d && cd ..`
- Build docker images for cwa-server: `cd cwa-server && docker compose build`
    - If build fails for localhost connection issues you will need to change all `localhost/releases` reference in pom files found in `cwa-server` and `json-schema` folders with `host.docker.internal/releases`
- (optional) stop reposilite docker image, it may brake things later
- Run docker images for cwa-server: `docker compose up`
- One of the service (e.g. submission) should fail after few seconds with "Pirates!" output -> that comes from the highjacked class
